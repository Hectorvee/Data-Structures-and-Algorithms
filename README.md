# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This repository contains my learning materials, code implementations, and project exercises as I explore the concepts from the textbook:  
*Data Structures and Algorithms in Javaâ„¢*, Sixth Edition by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of data structures and algorithms. The key topics covered include:

- **Java Basics and Object-Oriented Principles**
- **Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Lists and Iterators**
- **Trees**
- **Priority Queues, Heaps, and Adaptable Priority Queues**
- **Maps and Hash Tables**
- **Dictionary and Skip Lists**
- **Search Trees**
- **Graphs**

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, I aim to:

- Explain in detail the theoretical aspects of data structures.
- Develop short programs in Java that apply these data structures.
- Implement a practical project demonstrating proficiency with abstract data structures.
- Comment on the efficiency of various data structures in different applications.
- Estimate the performance of algorithms regarding execution time and memory usage.
